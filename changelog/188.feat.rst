Users can now exclude folders from the search scope of ``dbt-sugar`` by providing a list of folder names to exclude in the ``sugar_config.yml`` via the ``excluded_folders:`` config argument. ``dbt-sugar`` will not look for models contained in any of these folders for both the ``audit`` and ``doc`` tasks (as well as all other new tasks in this tool unless explicitly mentioned in future releaeses).
