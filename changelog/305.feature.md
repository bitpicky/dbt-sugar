Users can now prevent their `.yaml` files to be re-formated (sorted alphabetically) by setting the `sugar_config.yml` variable `preserve_yaml_order: true` at syrup-level or via the CLI at runtime by adding the `--preserve-yaml-order` flag. **This is also a good way to ensure that comments will be preserved if you use them in model descriptor files**.
