# dbt-sugar Roadmap ðŸ›£ ðŸš§

We're currently focusing on getting a basic minimum viable product out for dbt-sugar. You can follow the development and planned work by monitoring our [projects page](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/projects).

## MVP Release: Nils Frahm - All Melody - v0.0.0

This release focuses on shipping basic features to get the project going. We want to solve the following:

- Provide users with a tool to **document dbt models and their columns via a simple CLI flow**.
- Provide users with a tool to easily add **tests** (and assert that they are true right at the moment where they are being added) to their dbt models.
- Provide users with a tool to easily add **tags** to their dbt models.

## Toxe - Honey Island - v0.1.0

This release will focus on making the basic features shipped in `v0.0.0` smarter:

- Auto-generate tests on systematic columns. For example, users often declare `primary_key`s in their dbt `{{config()}}`. We could use this information to auto-add or suggest dbt builtin tests such as `['unique', 'not_null']` or even relational integrity tests.
- Allow users to propose patterns according to their column naming conventions which would make dbt-sugar **auto-add tags** such as **PII** field.
- Allow users to propose patterns and test rules (test name + optional argument) which dbt-sugar could auto add. For example, in a [recent article](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/column-name-contracts/), written by [Emily Riederer](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/) on the concept of "Column names as contracts", they propose that data modellers should follow strict and almost auto-documenting column names such as `ID_<ENTITY>`, or `CAT_<ENTITY>` to indicate the nature of the column content but, and most importantly, to allow easy machine parsing of those columns at consumption point.

## v0.2.0

In this, yet to be named release, we plan to add a new set of tasks besides documentation:

- A **audit** task which would provide test and documntation coverage to users.
- A **validate** task which would allow users to compare their development table vs. a production version and perform a series of tests such as:
  - column and row counts
  - distributional analyses (means, mediand, histograms etc) --we will probably leverage the [Great Expectations API](https://greatexpectations.io/) to do so.
