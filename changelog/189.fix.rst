dbt-sugar now uses the user-provided list to exlude any number of tables from its scope.
  - If a user asks to document a model that is part of the exclude list the app will waise a ``ValueError`` and tell users why
  - Any model excluded from dbt-sugar's scope will also not be included in any of the ``dbt-sugar audit`` coverage statistics.
  ðŸš§ **BREAKING-CHANGE**: ``excluded_tables`` has been renamed to ``excluded_models`` to be consisten with dbt terminology. Users are advised to update their ``sugar_config.yml`` if they already used the ``excluded_tables`` config variable.
