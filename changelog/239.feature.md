When running `dbt-sugar audit` users can now trigger all models (as well as their columns) to have at least placeholders in schema.yml files by passing the `--bootstrap` optional argument. This ensures that the audit task is fully aware of all the models before running its checks.

**NOTE:** the `--bootstrap` option will check for all of your models against your database and may be slower but it will give you the most accurate coverage statistics.
