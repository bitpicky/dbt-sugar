dbt-sugar can now automatically generate bootstrap model descriptor files (schema.yml) for all your models as well as their columns. Bootstrap model descriptors will contain eithe placeholders for undocumented columns and model descrptions, unless columns are documented in other models and in that case `bootstrap` will populate those columns with their definitions.

You can generate bootstraps by calling `dbt-sugar bootstrap`. Running `bootstrap` is particularly useful when you want to run an **exhaustive** `audit` on all your model since the `audit` task does not, by itself, check your models agains the database to make it less resource hungry. A follow up code-change will introduce an `--exhaustive` option on the `audit` task which will call `bootstrap` first and run `audit` after.
