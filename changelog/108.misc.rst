dbt-sugar will now run all the dbt tests available in your dbt project when you add them to a column. This means builtins but also any macros or anything coming from packages. The way it does so, is simply by running `dbt test` as a subprocess. We will revisit this when the dbt API hits `>=1.0.0` to use the internals or as soon as the innards of dbt tests are deemed more stable by the dbt Core team.
