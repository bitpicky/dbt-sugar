## dbt-sugar [0.0.0] - 2021-04-18

No significant changes.

# dbt-sugar v0.0.0-rc.2 (2021-04-10)

## Bug Fixes

- [\#205](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/205): The snowflake_connector now passes the expected warehouse parameter when creating a connection. This fixes an issue reported by [@sphinks](https://github.com/sphinks).

# dbt-sugar v.0.0.0-rc.0 (2021-04-06)

## Bug Fixes

- [\#187](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/187): The folder `dbt_modules` is now excluded from dbt-sugar's search path
- [\#189](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/189): dbt-sugar now uses the user-provided list to exclude any number of tables from its scope.

  - If a user asks to document a model that is part of the exclude list the app will raise a `ValueError` and tell users why
  - Any model excluded from dbt-sugar's scope will also not be included in any of the `dbt-sugar audit` coverage statistics.

  ðŸš§ **BREAKING-CHANGE**: `excluded_tables` has been renamed to `excluded_models` to be consistent with dbt terminology. Users are advised to update their `sugar_config.yml` if they already used the `excluded_tables` config variable.

## Features

- [\#188](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/188): Users can now exclude folders from the search scope of `dbt-sugar` by providing a list of folder names to exclude in the `sugar_config.yml` via the `excluded_folders:` config argument. `dbt-sugar` will not look for models contained in any of these folders for both the `audit` and `doc` tasks (as well as all other new tasks in this tool unless explicitly mentioned in future releaeses).
- [\#193](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/193): dbt sugar now supports arbitrarily named model property files (schema.yml). This means just like in [dbt core](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/model-properties) , users can name their model property files any way they like.

# dbt-sugar 0.0.0-b.0 (2021-03-31)

## Bug Fixes

- [\#167](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/167): When creating or modifying a model entry in schema.ymls we now ensure and guarantee that the model `name` and `description` keys are always first. Column names and descriptions are sorted alphabetically by column name however to make the `schema.yml` easier on th eyes.
- [\#173](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/173): Columns part of the yaml is now explicitly ordered to ensure the following:
  - name and descriptions come first even inside of the columns list
  - models names and description also always comes first
  - models and columns are sorted alphabetically across the schema.yml
- [\#180](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/180): Fixes a bug where `dbt-sugar` was looking for the `profiles.yml` file in the current working directory. This was because we were defaulting the `profiles_dir` to `Path(str())` which makes `pathlib` resolve to the current working directory. Resolves [\#177](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/177)

## Features

- [\#101](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/101): Users can control whether dbt-sugar should ask to add tests or tags via the following CLI arguments:
  - via CLI arguments on each run: `--ask-for-tests/--no-ask-for-tests` and `--ask-for-tags/--no-ask-for-tags` or
  - globally per `syrup` in the `sugar_config.yml` via the following arguments: `always_enforce_tests` and `always_add_tags`
- [\#102](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/102): Users can get the documentation and tests statistics with the command `dbt-sugar audit`
  - They can audit a full dbt project, which will return test and documentation coverage statistics for the entire project.
  - They can audit a specific model adding the parameter model, which will give detailed coverage for that specific model.
- [\#31](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/31): `dbt-sugar` requires a `sugar_config.yml` file which makes the following information available at run time:
  - `sugar_canes`: a (list of) dicts called `dbt_projects` which points to a user's dbt project name and path of where to find those projects. An `exclude_tables` list can optionally be provided if users want to exclude some tables from `dbt-sugar`'s analysis scope.
  - `defaults`: a dict of pointing to
    - a default `sugar_cane` to run (if not provided, users need to pass the following CLI arguments `--sugar-cane <cane_name>`
    - a default `target` pointing to a target from the `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` file in order to know which db to talk to and have access to its credentials and object destinations.
- [\#32](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/32): `dbt-sugar` checks that the dbt projects requires by `sugar_canes` are indeed present on disk. If any of them isn't a `MissingDbtProjects` error is raised and user is provided with a list of missing dbt projects. Later on, we might want to relax this to a warning and allow users to choose between a `--strict` or normal run, with normal runs throwing only a warning in this case.
- [\#36](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/36): `dbt-sugar` Doc task that allows the users to Document a model, this task will:
  - Check that the model exists in the DBT repository and where it is (to create the documentation in the same path).
  - Take the model columns from the database.
  - Create/Update the model in the schema.yml with the columns that we have taken in the previous step and the descriptions from the others columns documented (if is a new column name the description will be "No description for this column").
- [\#39](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/39): The concept of `sugar_cane` is renamed to `syrup` to avoid historically loaded interpretations.
- [\#46](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/46): `dbt-sugar` now offers the following UI/Front-End Flow:
  - model-level description writing
  - column-level description witing (only undocumented columns for now)
    - user can choose to document **all undocumented columns in one go** or **select a subset of columns to document**
- [\#50](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/50): `dbt-sugar` now offers documentation UI flow for **already documented columns**. The user is prompted to answer a "yes/no" to whether they want to document already documented columns. If they choose to do so they are presented with a list of columns to choose from. Each column also shows the current description. \<INSERT GIF OF FLOW WHEN GENERATING CHANGELOG\>
- [\#86](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/86): dbt-sugar will now ask users (and allow them) to add tags to their schema.yml files. PR for the backend flow [\#85](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/pull/85).
- [\#93](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/93): Introduces a temporary (until next feature release --or maybe in a patch) regression which will restrict dbt-sugar to only be able to manage **one** dbt project instead of more as was originally intended and hinted at by the use of plural `dbt_projects:` entry in `sugar_config.yml`.

## Under The Hood/Misc

- [\#27](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/27): `dbt-sugar` parses the profile information directly from dbt's `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` it will need to know which dbt project we want to document as well as the target from which to pull database credentials and schemas.
- [\#42](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/issues/42): `dbt-sugar` attempts to find it's config (`sugar_config.yml`) starting from the current working directory from which it is called and up to 4 directories above. If no configuration file is found `dbt-sugar` will throw a `FileNotFoundError` telling the user that the configuration file cannot be found and will print the current working directory to help the user debug the situation.
