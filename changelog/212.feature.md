Users of snowflake can decide to make the `dbt-sugar` connector use `describe table` when using the `doc` task instead of the native `snowflake.sqlalchemy.get_columns()` by setting the `use_describe_snowflake:` config argument to `true` or by passing the `--use-describe-snowflake` CLI argument. This method is a much faster way to get column information from snowflake's information schema. However, the developers of `snowflake.sqlachemy` opted for the less performant options for reasons that are not entirely clear at this point hence why we're making this an optional and **experimental** feature until we get more clarity in the following [issue](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-sqlalchemy/issues/221).
