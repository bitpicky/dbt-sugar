``dbt-sugar`` checks that the dbt projects requires by ``sugar_canes`` are indeed present on disk. If any of them isn't a ``MissingDbtProjects`` error is raised and user is provided with a list of missing dbt projects. Later on, we might want to relax this to a warning and allow users to choose between a ``--strict`` or normal run, with normal runs throwing only a warning in this case.
