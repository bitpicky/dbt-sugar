``dbt-sugar`` attempts to find it's config (``sugar_config.yml``) starting from the current working directory from which it is called and up to 4 directories above. If no configuration file is found ``dbt-sugar`` will throw a ``FileNotFoundError`` telling the user that the configuration file cannot be found and will print the current working directory to help the user debug the situation.
